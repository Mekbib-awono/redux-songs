This project is a demo to experiment with redux.

Redux is used to manage the state of the application where
User can add songs to the application
User can add songs to favorites / and remove them from favorites
User can "play" songs and the playcount of songs goes up and song is added to last-played-songs list
User can clear last-played songs list or remove only one song from the list, resetting the playcount 
User can remove a song from the whole list and this will remove the song from favorites and last-played
